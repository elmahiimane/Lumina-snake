# 🐍 Lumina Snake v1.0

This is a simple Snake game I built using Python's Turtle module. I wanted to see if I could make the classic game look a bit more modern, so I went with a dark neon theme and some smooth "breathing" animations for the food.



## 💡 Why I made this
I've always liked the original Snake, but the basic squares felt a bit dated. I spent some time messing around with `math.sin` to get the food to pulse and added some layered borders to create a glow effect without needing any heavy external libraries.

## 🚀 Cool Features
* **Neon Aesthetic:** Used a high-contrast palette (Cyan, Teal, and Crimson) on a midnight navy background.
* **Pulsing Orbs:** The food actually pulses in size while you play.
* **Clean Code:** Everything is wrapped in a main loop so it handles restarts properly without crashing the window.

## 💻 How to run it
You don't need to install anything special besides Python itself.

1. Clone the repo:
   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neon-snake.git`
2. Run the script:
   `python snake.py`

## 🎮 Controls
* Use the **Arrow Keys** to move.
* Don't hit the walls or yourself (standard rules).
* The game gets slightly faster every time you eat to keep things challenging.
